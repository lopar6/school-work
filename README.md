# School Work
### This is a repository to save and showcase projects done for school. 
This Repository does not hold every course I have taken, nor does it hold every project I have done. These are some of the projects I have worked on over the course of my education, organized by the course they were for. I have also listed out the computer science courses I have taken with a short description.  

## CS300 - Analysis and Design
This course was focused on learning how and when to use specific data structures, and writing and evaluating algorithms to improve performance. The main language used was used C++.  

### Course Planner Project
This project was a console application in C++ for creating a mock course planner. The goal was to utilized the data strucuters and algorithms learned throughout the course. 

## CS230 - Operating Platforms
This course showed a large overview of many different operating platforms. This included learning about operating systems, architecture design, and and introduction to REST API's. The lauguage used was Java, using dropwizard. 

### Project - Analyze and Recommend Archetecture and Platform
This was a project focusing on finding the best archetecture design pattern and platform for a theoretical new game. I learned a great deal about architecture patterns, and the pros and cons of various platforms. 

## CS210 - Programming Languages
This course was focused on teaching how to ultilize the best language for particular problems.The course also had a focus on building well-designed, well-documented, and readable code. The language used were Python, C++, and Java.

### Project 3 - Natural Grocers
This project was C++/Python console application simulating a grocery store product tracker. It allows users to see a list of products purchased in a given day, see how many times a specified item was purchased, and view a histogram of items purchased in a day.
In this project I did well by documenting my code, and writing it in an efficient manner. I could have done a better job making the application more efficient by not importing the entire standard library, and instead specifying the particular pieces I needed(std::cout). Before going into this project I had a fairly solid foundational understanding of C++ and Python. This project has helped me sharpin those skills. 

## CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle
This course was a designed to introduce students to different software development methodolgies. It had a strong focus in the agile method, particularly Scrum. Students took the role of various memebers of a team to get a since of how to effectively use the methodolgies, and why they are important.   

### Final Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective
This project was a culmination of the 'sprint' that took place over the length of the course. The end product was a review of the sprint, and the roles that each team member had during the course of it. 

## DAD-220 - 	Intro to Structured Database Envionment
This course was foucused on teaching the fundamnetals of relational database design. The main lauguage used was mySQL. This was a free elective. 

## CSCI 3080 - Discrete Structures
This course was focused on descrete mathimatical structures commonly used in programming. This included things like graph theory, set theory, logical operations, and data structures. The main language used was C++.

## CSCI 3130 - Assembly and Computer Org
This course was focused on how physical computer components work to create a funtioning system. It included builing a basic cpu and writing assembly code. 

## CSCI 2170 - Computer Science II
This course focused on object oriented programming practices, as well as introduction to algorithms. The main language used was C++.

## CS200 - Computer Science Role in Industry
This course focused on studying the different ways that computer science principles and practices are utilized in the real world. 

## IT-145 - Foundation in App Development
This course focused on good practices for effective object oriented programming. The main language used was Java.  

## CSCI 1170 - Computer Science I
This course focused on the fundamentals of computer science and object oriented programming. The main language used was Python. 

## MATH 1920 - Calculus II
This course focused on concepts like sequences, series, integration, indeterminate forms, and various applications thereof.
