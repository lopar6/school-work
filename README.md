# School Work
### This is a repository to save and showcase projects done for school. 
This Repository does not hold every course I have taken, nor does it hold every project I have done. These are some of the projects I have worked on over the course of my education, organized by the course they were for. I have also listed out the computer science courses I have taken with a short description.

## CS340 - Client/Server Development
The focus of this course was to learn how to build a full-stack application utilizing a database, backend, and frontend.

### 

### 3D scene project
In this project I used the skills learned throught the course to write an OpenGl application that replicates a personal picture. It includes a the uses of multiple primative shapes to build objects, projecting textures, applying lighting utilizing the phong shading model, nuanced camera controls, and 2D/3D perspectives that can be viewed at will by the user.

## CS330 - Computer Graphic and Visualization
The focus of this course was to learn how to use OpenGL in C++, learn about computer graphics, and the general approach to tackling difficult problems while crafting clean and readable code.

### 3D scene project

It includes a the uses of multiple primative shapes to build objects, projecting textures, applying lighting utilizing the phong shading model, nuanced camera controls, and 2D/3D perspectives that can be viewed at will by the user.

## CS320 - Software Test Automation & QA
The focus of this course was ensuring quality by throughly testing software. A major focus was writing proper unit tests that adequately determine if the code meets the requirements. Other testing methods like integration testing, end-to-end testing and many more also covered.

### Services Testing
In this project I wrote a few services and tests for those services. The tests ensured that the services met the requirments, were technically sound, and efficient.

## CS305 - Software Securtiy
In this course we focused on essential securtiy considerations when building and maintaining software. The primary focus was on building secure web applications that utilized modern methods of encryption, security layers, and good software practices. 

### Vulnerability Assessment Report
The vulnerability assessment project was a project where we utilized static testing in the form of dependency test, as well as reviewing the code to determine any vulnerablities present. The end result of was a report that outlines potental problems with the code, and how these problems may be resolved.

## MAT350 Applied Linear Algebra
This course's focus was linear algebra and matrices using MATLAB. Topics include systems of linear equations, linear independence, matrices of linear transformations, matrix algebra, determinants, vector spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. I then utilized these concepts and skills to model a selection of applied mathematics problems in business, science, computer science and economics.

## CS255 - System Analysis and Design
This purpose of this course was to learn the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that I can create system models using appropriate industry tools. I learned to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner as a part of creating system models.

### DriverPass Design Project
This was a project to help me learn how to utilize tools and techinques to design software systems. This involed collecting requiremnets, making diagrams, and communicating technical ideas in a non-technical way. 

## CS300 - Analysis and Design
This course was focused on learning how and when to use specific data structures, and writing and evaluating algorithms to improve performance. The main language used was used C++.

### Course Planner Project
This project was a console application in C++ for creating a mock course planner. The goal was to utilized the data strucuters and algorithms learned throughout the course. 

## CS230 - Operating Platforms
This course showed a large overview of many different operating platforms. This included learning about operating systems, architecture design, and and introduction to REST API's. The lauguage used was Java, using dropwizard. 

### Project - Analyze and Recommend Archetecture and Platform
This was a project focusing on finding the best archetecture design pattern and platform for a theoretical new game. I learned a great deal about architecture patterns, and the pros and cons of various platforms. 

## CS210 - Programming Languages
This course was focused on teaching how to ultilize the best language for particular problems.The course also had a focus on building well-designed, well-documented, and readable code. The language used were Python, C++, and Java.

### Project 3 - Natural Grocers
This project was C++/Python console application simulating a grocery store product tracker. It allows users to see a list of products purchased in a given day, see how many times a specified item was purchased, and view a histogram of items purchased in a day.
In this project I did well by documenting my code, and writing it in an efficient manner. I could have done a better job making the application more efficient by not importing the entire standard library, and instead specifying the particular pieces I needed(std::cout). Before going into this project I had a fairly solid foundational understanding of C++ and Python. This project has helped me sharpin those skills. 

## CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle
This course was a designed to introduce students to different software development methodolgies. It had a strong focus in the agile method, particularly Scrum. Students took the role of various memebers of a team to get a since of how to effectively use the methodolgies, and why they are important.

### Final Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective
This project was a culmination of the 'sprint' that took place over the length of the course. The end product was a review of the sprint, and the roles that each team member had during the course of it. 

## DAD-220 - 	Intro to Structured Database Envionment
This course was foucused on teaching the fundamnetals of relational database design. The main lauguage used was mySQL. This was a free elective. 

## CSCI 3080 - Discrete Structures
This course was focused on descrete mathimatical structures commonly used in programming. This included things like graph theory, set theory, logical operations, and data structures. The main language used was C++.

## CSCI 3130 - Assembly and Computer Org
This course was focused on how physical computer components work to create a funtioning system. It included builing a basic cpu and writing assembly code. 

## CSCI 2170 - Computer Science II
This course focused on object oriented programming practices, as well as introduction to algorithms. The main language used was C++.

## CS200 - Computer Science Role in Industry
This course focused on studying the different ways that computer science principles and practices are utilized in the real world. 

## IT-145 - Foundation in App Development
This course focused on good practices for effective object oriented programming. The main language used was Java.

## CSCI 1170 - Computer Science I
This course focused on the fundamentals of computer science and object oriented programming. The main language used was Python. 

## MATH 1920 - Calculus II
This course focused on concepts like sequences, series, integration, indeterminate forms, and various applications thereof.
