# school-work
### This is a repository to save and showcase projects done for school. 
This Repository does not hold every course I have taken, nor does it hold every project I have done. These are some of the projects I have worked on over the course of my education, orgainzed by the course they were for. 

## CS210 - Programming Languages
This course was designed to teach students to C++, and introduce students to using mulitple lauguages in the same application. The course also had a focus on building well-designed, well-documented, and readable code. 

### Project 3 - Natural Grocers
This project was C++/Python console application simulating a grocery store product tracker. It allows users to see a list of products purchased in a given day, see how many times a specified item was purchased, and view a histogram of items purchased in a day.
In this project I did well by documenting my code, and writing it in an efficient manner. I could have done a better job making the application more efficient by not importing the entire standard library, and instead specifying the particular pieces I needed(std::cout). Before going into this project I had a fairly solid foundational understanding of C++ and Python. This project has helped me sharpin those skills. 

## CS250 - Software Development Lifecycle
This course was a designed to introduce students to different software development methodolgies. It had a strong focus in the agile method, particularly Scrum. Students took the role of various memebers of a team to get a since of how to effectively use the methodolgies, and why they are important.   

### Final Project - Sprint Review and Retrospective
This project was a culmination of the 'sprint' that took place over the length of the course. The end product was a review of the sprint, and the roles that each team member had during the course of it.
